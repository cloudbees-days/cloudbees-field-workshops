# Getting Started

In order to complete the labs in this workshop you will need to have a personal GitHub Organization with the [CloudBees Feature Flags Workshop GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/cloudbees-feature-flags-workshop) installed on it. Also, by completing the GitHub components of the workshop setup before the workshop we will be able to focus on the CloudBees Feature Flags features covered in this workshop.
