# CloudBees CI Workshop

The CloudBees CI workshop is composed of two modules. The first is focused on product capabilities that make it easy to manage continuous integration at scale and the second is focused on features that provide a developer centric experience for software delivery. 

## Module 1: Manage Continuous Integration at Scale

These labs will provide hands-on examples that will show you how CloudBees CI enables shared services teams and Jenkins admins to provide highly scalable and easily manageable continuous integration for all of your software delivery teams. You will learn how CloudBees CI provides comprehensive centralized team management with features to manage Jenkins configuration as code, create and share templates for Jenkins pipelines, enforce pipeline policies and simplify collaboration across disparate development teams.

## Module 2: A Developer Centric Experience

These labs will provide hands-on examples that will show you how CloudBees CI enables developers to spend less time on admin tasks and more time coding. These labs will explore how the CloudBee CI developer centric features provide contextual Jenkins pipeline feedback, in tools such as GitHub and Slack, resulting in less context-switching. These labs will also explore how the scalability and central management of CloudBees CI allows developers to focus on writing and delivering software without being slowed down by their continuous integration tools and processes.
