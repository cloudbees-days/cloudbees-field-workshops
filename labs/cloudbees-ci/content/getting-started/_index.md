# Getting Started

In order to complete the labs in this workshop you will need to have a personal GitHub Organization with the [CloudBees CI Workshop GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/cloudbees-ci-workshop) installed on it. By completing the GitHub components of the workshop setup before the workshop we will be able to focus on the CloudBees CI features covered in this workshop.
