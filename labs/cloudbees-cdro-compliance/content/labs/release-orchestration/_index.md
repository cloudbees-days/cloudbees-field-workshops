# Module 1: Cloudbees Release Orchestration

The CloudBees CD/RO Service Catalogs help you accelerate application deployment. Service Catalogs automate routine deployment tasks and make them available as templates that end users can use by providing the minimum number of parameters and without the need to be a  CloudBees CD/RO expert.

The labs in this module will provide an overview of Service Catalogs. Labs include the creation of a custom Service Catalog item, and an example using a more complex Service Catalog item we provide.
Workshop Labs:

- Creating A Release From the Service Catalog
- Release Quality Gates
- Dealing with Security Exceptions
- Gathering Release Evidence
- Audit Ready Pipelines
- Release Command Center Dashboard
