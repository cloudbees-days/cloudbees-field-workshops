# Getting Started

In order to complete the labs in this workshop you will need to have a personal GitHub Organization with the [CloudBees CI Pipeline Workshop GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/cloudbees-ci-pipeline-workshop) installed on it. Also, by completing the GitHub components of the workshop setup before the workshop we will be able to focus on the content covered in this workshop.
