# CD Fundamentals : Overview of the Release Process.

- Releases allow you to group together multiple applications and their Pipelines into a single entity for a targeted release.

- With CloudBees CD, you can schedule and track the progress of your release process, using the Dashboards and Calendaring functionality that you will learn about in this course.

- It is not just the deployment of one Application that you need to automate, control, and monitor. In reality, most Releases consist of more than just one Application, they are usually a combination of
various Applications that have interdependencies, and work together to make your business successful.

- So let’s take a look at how those Applications are bundled into a Release.
