# CD Fundamentals : Overview of the Release Process.

- Releases allow you to group together multiple applications and their Pipelines into a single entity for a targeted release.

- With Flow (CD)  Releases you can schedule and track the progress of your release process, using the Dashboards and Calendaring functionality that you will learn about in this course.

various Applications that have interdependencies, and work together to make your business successful.

- So let’s take a look at how those Applications are bundled into a Release.
