# Workshop Tools Overview

* We highly recommend using Google Chrome as the web browser - other browsers will work, but we have found Chrome to work best with the GitHub editor.
* We will be using Zoom breakout rooms for the majority of the workshop material.
* Please use the Zoom chat to introduce yourself and if you have any questions.
* After an overview of CloudBees CI you will be grouped into Zoom breakout rooms where you will complete the workshop labs.
* Once in the breakout rooms please feel free to ask questions via audio or via the Zoom chat. You may also use the Zoom *Nonverbal* feedback feature to raise your hand or to ask you instructor to slow down or speed up. NOTE: The chat is only broadcast to your breakout room.

# Lab Environment
* This workshop uses a CloudBees CI cluster, an enterprise version of Jenkins, running on the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
  * Each attendee will have their own Jenkins instance provisioned as if you were a team. We refer to these as a ***managed controller*** since they are dynamically provisioned on Kubernetes and their full lifecycle is **managed** by the CloudBees CI Operations Center.
* All the instructions for the labs and these slides are publicly available.
* Attendees will be using their own GitHub accounts. 
* **IMPORTANT:** If you haven't already completed the *Pre-Workshop Setup* then do so here: https://cloudbees-ci.labs.cb-sa.io/getting-started/pre-workshop-setup/


.footnote[.bold[*] Please note, it is unlikely that we will get through all the material. However, all of the lab material is freely available on GitHub and can be self-led. The CloudBees CI lab environment will be available until next Monday if you would like to complete any labs we don't get through.]

CloudBees CI on Kubernetes

???
They dynamic provisioning of a ***managed controller*** (team specific Jenkins instance) provided by CloudBees CI on Kubernetes makes it easy and quick to provide a centrally managed Jenkins instance for every team.
* **Less downtime:** Liveness and readiness for *managed controllers* and Operations Center thanks to Kubernetes Stateful Sets
* **Ephemeral agents:** Agents are deployed as containers via Kubernetes pods. They are created and destroyed during pipeline runs.
* **Kubernetes agent templates:** Templates can be defined for Kubernetes Pod based agents, shared with the whole cluster or defined at the team level.
Different Kubernetes clouds can be configured and shared from OC or at the individual team level, enabling hybrid and multi-cloud use cases.

# Manage Jenkins at Scale
* Curated and verified Jenkins plug-ins with the **CloudBees Assurance Program (CAP)** ensures you are using the most up-to-date and secure plugin-in versions via monthly security and functionality releases 
* Configuration as Code for Jenkins and CloudBees CI commercial components; including plugin management and job configuration
* Enables Comprehensive Jenkins Team Management including:
  * Easily provision *managed controllers* (Jenkins instance) per team
  * Centrally managed Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
  * Centralized and per team Credentials Management
  * Managing inbound events across multiple *managed controllers*
