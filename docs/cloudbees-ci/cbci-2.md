# Pipeline Template Catalogs

Pipeline Template Catalogs provide version controlled parameterized templates for Multibranch and stand-alone Pipeline jobs, helping to ensure that Pipeline jobs conform to organizational standards.

Benefits of using Pipeline Template Catalogs include:

* Providing developers with a simplified and directed experience for configuring Pipeline in “domain specific” terms that make sense for an organization. This allows developers to focus on shipping software.
* Organizing Pipelines per projects and/or teams. Similar-looking jobs that only differ in a few aspects can be easily parameterized on a per job basis. When you change a template, all the jobs created from that template get updated automatically.

When combined with Pipeline Shared Libraries, Pipeline Template Catalogs provide an easy way to make your organization's Pipelines reusable — boosting cross-team collaboration, saving time and reducing errors.

Pipeline Template Catalogs help ensure that Pipeline jobs conform to organizational standards and when used in combination with Shared Libraries provide reusable Pipelines — boosting cross-team collaborations, saving time and reducing errors.

Pipeline Shared Libraries and Pipeline Template Catalogs can 'live' in the same source code repository.

# Lab - Pipeline Template Catalog

* In this lab you will explore a Pipeline Template Catalog from the `pipeline-template-catalog` repository that was copied into your workshop GitHub Organization and installed on your managed controller with CloudBees CI Configuration as Code.
* Create a folder that only allows creating jobs from certain templates.
* Create a job from a Pipeline Template Catalog template.
* The *Pipeline Template Catalog* lab instructions are available at: 
  * https://cloudbees-ci.labs.cb-sa.io/module-1/pipeline-template-catalog/
