# CD Fundamentals : Overview of Deployment Automation

- CloudBees CD/RO deploy makes deployments manageable, reproducible, and error-proof by modeling the application or microservice, the environments to which it will be deployed, and automating the workflow needed for the deployment.The model can be broken into these parts of your application or microservice deployment:

  - What—You are deploying the application or microservice, which contains references to the files being deployed.

  - Where—The application or microservice will be deployed to a CloudBees CD/RO environment.

  - How—You run processes that orchestrate deployment tasks to deploy the application or microservice to the environment.
