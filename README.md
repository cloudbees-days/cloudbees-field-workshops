These workshops demonstrate how to  effectively use CI/CD practices, manage feature flags, and orchestrating releases with CloudBees CI, CloudBees Feature Management, and CloudBees CD products.

# Workshop Prerequisites

* Internet access to include access to https://github.com and to include the ability to access and use the [GitHub File Editor](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository).
* Access to https://app.slack.com
* An account on https://github.com and a basic understanding of how to use GitHub to do things like fork a repository, edit files in the web UI, and create pull requests.
* Finally, we highly recommend using the Google Chrome browser to work through the lab content.

# Workshop Labs & Slides

## CloudBees CI Workshop

The CloudBees CI workshop is composed of two distinct sets of labs. The first is focused on product capabilities that make it easy to manage continuous integration at scale and the second is focused on features that provide a developer centric experience for software delivery. 

### Manage Continuous Integration at Scale
These labs will provide hands-on examples that will show you how CloudBees CI enables shared services teams and Jenkins admins to provide highly scalable and easily manageable continuous integration for all of your software delivery teams. You will learn how CloudBees CI provides comprehensive centralized team management with features to manage Jenkins configuration as code, create and share templates for Jenkins pipelines, enforce pipeline policies and simplify collaboration across disparate development teams.

### A Developer Centric Experience
These labs will provide hands-on examples that will show you how CloudBees CI enables developers to spend less time on admin tasks and more time coding. These labs will explore how the CloudBee CI developer centric features provide contextual Jenkins pipeline feedback, in tools such as GitHub and Slack, resulting in less context-switching. These labs will also explore how the scalability and central management of CloudBees CI allows developers to focus on writing and delivering software without being slowed down by their continuous integration tools and processes.

## CloudBees CI Declarative Pipeline Workshop

This workshop will provide a basic understanding of how to create and manage Jenkins CI/CD Declarative Pipelines leveraging developer focused features of CloudBees CI.

The workshop contains instructions and learning materials that are designed to teach the following key concepts:

  * How specific features of CloudBees CI on Kubernetes will accelerate your continuous delivery?
  * Why you should *mostly* use [Declarative](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#declarative-pipeline) vs [Scripted](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#scripted-pipeline) pipelines?
  * How reusable templates for Jenkins Declarative Pipelines can increase developer productivity?
  * What are the key features of Declarative Pipelines?

### Workshop Prerequisites

* A basic understanding of Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
* A basic understanding of Kubernetes: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/
* A basic understanding of Jenkins Pipelines: https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started/
